# Snort VM Setup

1. Edit 'Ubuntu Server - Snort' VM Settings .

2. Run 'Ubuntu Server - Snort' VM

Note: Running commands in Ubuntu Servers might give you trouble especially when you want to copy paste text and scroll on the logs.
The solution is to SSH into your VM from your Windows Local Machine.

```
2. Install Snort:
- Update packages: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`
- Install Snort: `sudo apt install snort`
- Configure Snort `sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf`

3. Snort.conf - setup snort to detect all network traffic including from our own
```
# Set up the network addresses you are protecting
ipvar HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24

# Set up the external network addresses. Leave as "any" in most situations
ipvar EXTERNAL_NET any

```

# Running Snort Options
1. Run snort in Test mode to check that there is no error in configurations
	
```
sudo snort -T -c /etc/snort/snort.conf
```

2. Running snort in verbose mode for more detailed output
```
sudo snort -v -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
```
- Eth0 - interface name
3. Running snort in IDS mode
```
sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
```
4. Snort alerts are in `cd /var/log/snort`

# Running Snort as a Service
By default, Snort does not automatically run on startup after installation. You need to manually start it each time, or you can set it up to run as a service so that it starts automatically when the Ubuntu server boots up. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

## Creating a Systemd Service for Snort

1. Create a Systemd Service File: 
	Open a new file in `/etc/systemd/system/` named `snort.service` with a text editor, for example, using `nano`:
    ```
	sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/snort.service
	``` 
     
2. Add the Service Configuration
	```
	[Unit]
	Description=Snort NIDS Service
	After=syslog.target network.target

	[Service]
	Type=simple
	ExecStart=/usr/sbin/snort -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i ens33

	[Install]
	WantedBy=multi-user.target
	```
   - Replace `ens33` with your network interface you want Snort to monitor (e.i `eth0`, `ens33`).
   - The `-q` flag runs Snort in quiet mode, and `-c` specifies the configuration file.

3. Reload Systemd
	After saving and closing the file, reload the systemd manager configuration:
	```
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	```

4. Enable and Start Snort Service:
	Enable the service so it starts on boot:
	```
 	sudo systemctl enable snort.service
	```
    
	Start the service:
    ```
	sudo systemctl start snort.service
	```
     
5. Check the Service Status
	To ensure the service is running properly, check its status:
	```
	sudo systemctl status snort.service
	```
