### On VM1 (Snort Machine):

#### 1. **Install Filebeat**

[FileBeat Installation Reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/8.11/setup-repositories.html#_apt)

1. **Download and install the Public Signing Key**:
  ```bash
  wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
  ```

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
  ```

  ```bash
  echo "deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list
  ```
2. **Download and Install Filebeat**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install filebeat
     ```

#### 2. **Configure Filebeat**

1. **Edit the Filebeat Configuration File**:
   - The main configuration file for Filebeat is located at `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`. You'll need to edit this file to specify the location of your Snort logs and the details of your ELK Stack server.
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
     ```

2. **Configure Filebeat to Read Snort Logs**:
   - Under `filebeat.inputs`, configure Filebeat to read from your Snort log files. Specify the path to the logs.
     ```yaml
     filebeat.inputs:
     - type: filestream
       enabled: true
       paths:
         - /var/log/snort/*.alert*
     ```
     
3. **Configure Output to Logstash**:
   - Comment out the Elasticsearch output section and configure the Logstash output.
     ```yaml
     #output.elasticsearch:
     #  hosts: ["localhost:9200"]

     output.logstash:
       hosts: ["VM2_IP:5044"]
     ```
   - Replace `VM2_IP` with the IP address of VM2 where Logstash is installed.

4. **Enable and Start Filebeat Service**:
   - After configuring Filebeat, enable and start the service.
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl enable filebeat
     ```
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start filebeat
     ```
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status filebeat
     ```

### On VM2 (ELK Stack Machine):

#### 1. **Configure Logstash**

1. **Edit Logstash Configuration**:
   - Create a new Logstash configuration file or edit an existing one in the `/etc/logstash/conf.d/` directory.
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/logstash/conf.d/01-filebeat-input.conf
     ```
   
2. **Input Configuration**:
   - Set up Logstash to listen for input from Filebeat.
     ```conf
     input {
       beats {
         port => 5044
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Filter Configuration** (Optional):
   - You may want to add filter configurations to parse the Snort logs properly.
   - This step depends on the format of your Snort logs and might involve writing Grok patterns.

4. **Output Configuration**:
   - Configure the output to Elasticsearch, typically in a separate configuration file.
     ```conf
      output {
          elasticsearch {
            hosts => ["https://192.168.1.114:9200"]
            index => "snort-logs-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
            ssl => true
            cacert => "/etc/elasticsearch/certs/http_ca.crt"
            user => "elastic"
            password => "your elastic password"
          }
      }
     ```

5. **Restart Logstash Service**:
   - After editing the configuration, restart Logstash to apply the changes.
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart logstash
     ```

### Verify the Setup

- **Check Filebeat Logs** on VM1 to ensure it's running without errors and can connect to Logstash on VM2.
- **Check Logstash Logs** on VM2 for any connection issues or errors in processing the logs.
- **Kibana**: Once the setup is verified, you should see Snort logs in Kibana on VM2, where you can create dashboards and visualizations based on the Snort log data.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure your network security allows traffic on the necessary ports (like 5044 for Logstash).
- Consider encrypting the data in transit, especially if it's moving across untrusted networks.
- Keep your Filebeat and Logstash instances updated for security and stability.
