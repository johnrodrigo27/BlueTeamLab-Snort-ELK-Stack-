## Create an index pattern, explore the data, and set up a dashboard

### Step 1: Create an Index Pattern and Explore Data

1. **Open Kibana**: Access the Kibana web interface.
2. **Open Discover**: Navigate to the "Discover" section in Kibana.
3. **Create Data View**: Click "Create Data View". 
4. **Create Index Pattern**:
   - Enter name for your data view. i.e "Snort Logs"
   - Click “Create index pattern”.
   - Enter the index pattern that matches your Snort logs. It might be something like `snort-*` or similar, depending on how you’ve configured FileBeat and Logstash.
5. **Save Data View**: Click "Save data view to Kibana".

### Step 2: Visualize Data

1. **Access Visualize Library**: Go to the "Analytics", "Visualize Library" section in Kibana. Click "Create new visualization".

2. **Create a New Visualization**:
   - Select "Lens"
   - Select the type of visualization (e.g., bar chart, line chart, data table).
   - Choose the Snort index pattern.
   - Configure your visualization by selecting the fields to display and setting up metrics and buckets. For instance, you might create a bar chart showing the number of alerts per type.

3. **Save Visualization**: After setting up, save your visualization for use in dashboards.

### Step 3: Create a Dashboard

1. **Open Dashboard Section**: Go to the "Dashboard" area in Kibana.

2. **Create a New Dashboard**:
   - Click “Create new dashboard”.
   - Click “Add” or “Add visualization” to start adding your saved visualizations.

3. **Arrange Dashboard**:
   - Add multiple visualizations you created (like alert types, traffic sources).
   - Arrange and resize them as per your preference.

4. **Save Dashboard**: Give your dashboard a meaningful name and save it.

5. **Access and Use Dashboard**: Your dashboard is now ready to be used for ongoing monitoring. You can access it anytime to get an overview of your network’s security status as captured by Snort.

### Step 5: Regular Review and Adjustment

- **Periodic Review**: Regularly review the dashboard to monitor network security.
- **Adjust as Needed**: Over time, you might need to adjust your visualizations and dashboard as you understand more about the data and your monitoring needs evolve.
