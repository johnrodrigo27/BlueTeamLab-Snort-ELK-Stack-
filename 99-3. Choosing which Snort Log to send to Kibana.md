## To integrate Snort with the ELK stack via Filebeat, you'll need to choose the appropriate log files that Filebeat should monitor and forward. 
1. **`snort.alert`**: This file contains alert messages in a full-text, human-readable format. It's useful for a detailed understanding of each alert.

2. **`snort.alert.fast`**: This file also contains alert messages but in a 'fast' format, which is more concise than the full alert format. It includes the essential information for each alert and is typically less verbose than `snort.alert`.

3. **`snort.alert.fast.1.gz`**: This is a compressed archive of older alerts in the fast format. It's not typically used for real-time monitoring because it's compressed and contains historical data.

4. **`snort.log`**: This is a binary file containing packet data. It requires Snort or other specialized tools to read and interpret.

### Which Files to Forward to Filebeat-ELK Stack:

- **Primary Choice**: `snort.alert.fast`. This file is generally the best choice for integration with Filebeat and ELK stack because it provides a concise summary of each alert, which is more manageable for log processing and visualization in Kibana.

- **Secondary Choice**: `snort.alert`. You can opt to use this if you need more detailed alert information in your ELK stack.

- **Not Recommended**: `snort.log` and `snort.alert.fast.1.gz`. The binary format of `snort.log` is not directly compatible with ELK stack visualization tools without preprocessing. The compressed `snort.alert.fast.1.gz` is historical data, which is not typically useful for real-time monitoring.

### Configuring Filebeat:

1. **Edit Filebeat Configuration**:
   Open the Filebeat configuration file (usually located at `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`) and set it up to monitor the chosen log file (e.g., `snort.alert.fast`).

2. **Add Input Configuration**:
   Under the `filebeat.inputs` section, you might add something like:
   ```yaml
   - type: log
     enabled: true
     paths:
       - /var/log/snort/snort.alert.fast
   ```

3. **Set Output to Logstash**:
   Ensure the output is configured to send data to your Logstash server.

4. **Restart Filebeat**:
   After making changes, restart Filebeat to apply the new configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart filebeat
   ```

5. **Verify Data Flow**:
   Check that Filebeat is successfully sending the logs to Logstash, and that Logstash is processing and forwarding them to Elasticsearch. Finally, you should see the data appearing in Kibana.

By following these steps, you can effectively forward Snort logs to the ELK stack for comprehensive monitoring and analysis.

Added note: How the log outputs are coded is determined in `/etc/snort/snort.conf`
