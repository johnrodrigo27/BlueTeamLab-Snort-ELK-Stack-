## Issue: File does not exist or cannot be opened /etc/elasticsearch/certs/http_ca.crt 
    cacert => "/etc/elasticsearch/certs/http_ca.crt"

- Error encounter in logstash log `cat /var/log/logstash/logstash-plain.log`
- Error source in `cd /etc/logstash/conf.d/` configuration file. `ls` - to list all files in it.

## Solution:
1. check file permission on "/etc/elasticsearch/certs/http_ca.crt"
    ```bash
    ls -l /etc/elasticsearch/certs/http_ca.crt
    ```
2. if logstash is not there add it
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -a -G elasticsearch logstash
    ```
3. restart logstash service
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart logstash
    ```
4. Check Kibana, "Stack Management", "Index Management". The snort logs will be there when the data starts flowing in from filebeat.
